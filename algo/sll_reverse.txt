# Reverse a singly linked list

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Define a structure for the nodes
    2.1 It has two items; data and link

Step 3: Define a head pointer and set it to NULL

Step 4: Display the options to insert, display, revere and exit

Step 5: If the choice is to insert, do steps 5.1 to 5.5
    5.1: Read in the value to insert
    5.2: Create a new node
    5.3: new->data = value
    5.4: new->link = head
    5.5: head = new

Step 6: Else if the choice is to display, do steps 6.1 to 6.3
    6.1: Define a pointer ptr and set it to head
    6.2: If head == NULL, then
            Print List is empty
    6.3: Else
            while ptr != NULL, do
                Print ptr->data
                ptr = ptr->link
            endwhile
        endif

Step 7: Else if the choice is to reverse, do steps 7.1 to 7.3
    7.1: Define a pointer prev set to NULL
    7.2: Define a pointer curr set to head
    7.3: while curr != NULL, do
            head = curr
            curr = curr->link
            head->link = prev
            prev = head
        endwhile

Step 8: Else if the choice is to exit, go to step 9

Step 9: Stop
